Blockchain Project

What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a ditributed and decentralised ledger which stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its network.

ledger: record keeping book that stores all the transactions of an organisation.

Decentralisation leads to a trustless system.

Use-cases
- Cryptocurrency
  - a cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange
  - 3 main features: a secure blockchain, wallets and mining
  - kept secure by wide-spread public access to the ledger and use of cryptography to generate digital signatures.

Digital signatures
Public and private keys
- user can sign transaction using private key - generating a hash
- if keys do not match - we can know the data has been tampered with

Wallets
- objects that store the individuals private and public keys
- public key is the address of the wallet
- help sign transactions
